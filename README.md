# Complex-Table

## My one day of workðŸ™‚


### This table forced my limits and led me to some discoveries.
One of them is that the combination of nth-child and another  property may result in a powerful output. I have been stuck on how I would erase the left side of a table cell for a day. There was no YouTube videos or references. But this discovery solved my problem in a few second. Another use of this function is that I can make large empty columns which are identical to other columns containing data.
